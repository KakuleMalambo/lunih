This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
This is our LIEPAJA UNIVERSITY NEW IDEA HUB(LUNIH) repository, all the codes will be on this repository, i already created a started project and some pages
like home page, next from my part will be login, sign up pages and connections to database.
The best way to work with this repository is to fork it, so you can add your own module or part of the project, and then make a pull request to that we can test it together and see if it does not break anything else in the code.
for now the repo is public 
## Getting Started
First, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm i or npm install
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## About this project

It includes various user groups (students, guests, university staff, company representatives) with specific actions (applying for posts, publishing, reviewing applications, etc.) and incorporates user and post management functionalities.
